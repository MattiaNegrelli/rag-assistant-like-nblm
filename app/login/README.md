# Authentication

Simple authentication layer for the application.

## Overview

Currently, this provides a basic entry point. Future enhancements may include:
- Integration with Auth0 or NextAuth.js.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).

## Components

- **`page.tsx`**: Use client-side logic to handle login form submission.

## Usage

The user is redirected here if unauthenticated.
